google-keyword-checker
======================
A working version of this code can be found live at http://wheredoirank.net/

The purpose is to check Google to see what page your domain falls under in the search results for given keyword(s)

I had some help along the way with design from the skeleton framework [http://www.getskeleton.com/]
and a great library for remotely fetching content with PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser [http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehtmldom/]

Both projects above are licensed under MIT as well as my code, enjoy!
